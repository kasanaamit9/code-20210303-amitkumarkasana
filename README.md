Hello,

I have completed the coding for given(in email) assessment. Also, I came across a few doubts when I started the assessment that I needed to clarify. Please find below the details.

Calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) using Formula 1 , BMI Category and Health risk from Table 1 of the person and add them as 3 new columns --- after I have the BMI of a person, where exactly these 3 columns should be added? Is it a new list of objects (json).?

Count the total number of overweight people using ranges in the column BMI Category of Table 1, check this is consistent programmatically and add any other observations in the documentation
---- could you please clarify what do you mean by documentation here?

I had sent an email also mentioning above doubts but could not get any response due to some communication issue. So, I completed coding with the whatever understanding I had of the problem. Please assess accordingly.

**To run the code**, you just have to execute the 'run.bat' file, which will execute the 'assessment.py' with required arguments as well as the 'test_assessment.py' file. The input json file 'person_list.json' with around 1 lakh people's data is ingested by the script file and the output file 'bmi_result.json' for the input data is generated. we can give different input json file and different output json filename by editing the arguments inside 'run.bat' script. Also, both .py script files' data will be written into log files, names of which can also be edited from 'run.bat' script.
